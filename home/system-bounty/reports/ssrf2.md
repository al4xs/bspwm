# Summary

Hi team, your web app is vulnerable to SSRF.

## Overview of the Vulnerability
Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that exploits the trust relationship between a server and an application, or other backend systems. An attacker can take advantage of this trust to forge server-side traffic and make HTTP requests to internal or external domains. A SSRF vulnerability was found in this application which allows an attacker to perform a request to an internally networked resource, which is considered high impact.

## Business Impact

SSRF can lead to data theft and through an attacker accessing, deleting, or modifying data from within the application via their access to server-side systems. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
2. Use a browser to login and navigate to: {{data}}
3. Forward the following payload to the endpoint:

```
```

4. Observe the sensitive response
